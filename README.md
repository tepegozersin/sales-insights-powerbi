# üìä Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## üîé Overview  
This project showcases a **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze sales performance, product profitability, and customer behavior.  
The dataset was restructured from a flat file into a **star schema model** with multiple fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient queries and scalable analysis.  
In addition, **10+ custom DAX measures** (including YTD/MTD metrics, Profit Margin, CLV, and Shipment KPIs) were created to provide deeper insights.  

The goal is to deliver actionable insights for executives and stakeholders, supporting data-driven decisions in areas such as **regional sales trends, product category performance, and customer segmentation**.

## üìÇ Dataset  
- **Source:** [Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)  
- The original dataset was provided as a **single flat table** (`superstore.csv`).  
- For professional reporting and scalability, the data was restructured into a **star schema** with proper **dimension and fact tables**.  

---

## üõ† Data Modeling & Measures  
- Built a **star schema data model** to improve performance and analytical flexibility.  
- Established relationships between:  
  - **Fact Table**: FactSales  
  - **Dimension Tables**: DimProducts, DimCustomers, DimRegions, DimDate  
- Developed **10+ DAX measures** for advanced analytics, including:  
  - **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Profit Margin**  
  - **Year-to-Date (YTD)** and **Month-to-Date (MTD)** metrics  
  - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**  
  - **Shipment Status metrics**  

> ‚ö° By restructuring the dataset and creating reusable DAX measures, the dashboard provides **faster performance, better scalability, and deeper insights** compared to working with a single flat table.
